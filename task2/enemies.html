<h1>Encountering Enemies</h1>
<hr><i>This diagram helps explain the game implemetnter's view and also giving the core view of the above scenario in the game</i><hr>

<img src = "DIAG 2.png">
<pre>

The diagram has a player class with three functions namely - system, update, and supply location,
which function in a continous loop. From system to update and then system again.
Similarly enemy contains the same functions as player and processes the
same loop as the player class.
Detection to event - acknowledges the whereabouts of the player to the enemy.

<h1>DECEPTION- Falling into a Trap.</h1>
<hr><i>Diagram shows interaction between Player and Deception</i><hr>
<pre>
<img src = "image1.jpg" height="422" width="822">

Explanation:-

NOTE: Till further updated, System is meanwhile also handling the location and inputs from the actual player
      along with collison detection.

Functions :- System, Deception, Player, Lives, End Game, Scores.

- System:- Confirms the collision detection from the UNITY ENGINE. Henceforth, reports
           to Deception.
- Deception:- On receiving confirmation from System that collison(Confirmation that player has fallen into trap) has taken place, it
               calls the player.
- Player:- On recieving confirmation from Deception:
                    - Updates the no. of lives.
                    - Updates the no. of scores.
- Lives:- Once the lives reach to a minimum, it calls End Game, which henceforth changes the screen.

<h1>Roaming Enemy</h1>
<hr><i>Diagram shows interaction between Player and Roaming Enemy</i><hr>
<pre>
<img src = "image2.jpg" height="422" width="822">

Explanation:-

Functions :- System, Roaming Enemy, Player, Lives, End Game, Scores, increase in speed.

- System:- Confirms the collision detection from the UNITY ENGINE. Henceforth, reports
           to Roaming Enemy.
- Roaming Enemy:- On receiving confirmation from System that collison(Confirmation that player has interacted with the player) has taken place, it
               calls the player but this happens in two different scenarios:
                       - If the collision detection is reported of interaction between the player's attack on the enemy then the
                          enemy calls the player to confirm the "kill" scenario.
                       - If the collision detection is reported of the approaching distance of player near the enemy, enemy then calls
                         the player to confirm the attack scenario(when enemy attaks the player) and also calls "increase in speed" function(To increase the speed 
                         near the player).
- Player:- On recieving confirmation from Roaming Enemy:
                    - On recieving the kill scenario confirmation:
                             - Updates the no. of lives.
                             - Updates the no. of scores.
                    - On receiving the attack scenario confirmation:
                             - Updates the no. of lives.
                             - Updates the no. of scores.
- Lives:- Once the lives reach to a minimum, it calls End Game, which henceforth changes the screen.

<h1>Player's view</h1>
<hr><i>This is how the player will view encountering enemies</i><hr>
<pre>
HERE WE FOCUS ON COLLISON DETECTION AND ITS EFFECTS AFTERMATH:

When the player approaches towards the enemy in the zone, the detection traingle around the 
enemy gets activated and enemy begans to move to and fro at a faster rate. 
So when the player touches the enemy it gets killed and a life is reduced at the top corner of the screen.
