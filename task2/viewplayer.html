HERE WE FOCUS ON COLLISON DETECTION AND ITS EFFECTS AFTERMATH:

When the player approaches towards the enemy in the zone, the detection traingle around the 
enemy gets activated and enemy begans to move to and fro at a faster rate. 
So when the player touches the enemy it gets killed and a life is reduced at the top corner of the screen.
