<pre>
  From the start menu (the first screen to appear when the game loads),
  the player will be able to see 2 buttons. The first button will say 
  'Start' and the second button will say 'Exit'. The Start button will 
  load up things for the game such as the map, enemies, the player, and
  other various objects. It will also give the player their initial score
  of 0 and start a timer. Pressing the Exit button will simply exit the game.

  The Start screen will have 2 buttons that can be pressed, the 'Start' 
  button and the 'Exit' button. When the Start button is pressed, a method
  will be called to initialize the game and display things like the timer
  and score. Then the first scene for the map will be loaded along with the
  player and enemies. Upon pressing the Exit button, the game will then exit
  and the user will be returned to desktop.
