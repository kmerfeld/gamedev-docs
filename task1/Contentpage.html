<hr><i>Basic Gameplay</i><hr>

<pre>
The game is going to be split up into 4 main levels,
each will be played in a separate direction (up, down, left, right).
The player will hvae to get into a castle which will be the background for a couple of levels.
There will also be a mini boss at the end of each level.
We will have various "powerups" to assist the player on the way to the 
finish of the level.
