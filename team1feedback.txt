Start screen: good explanation

Map: not completly clear. 
No clear division of player and developer perspective.
What all levels the game has?

Player scenario: all scenarios are included in one.
Could have given detail explanation.
Some terms are not clear(for example: which checkpoint)

View of Player vs Enemy Scenario, Encountering Enemies: 
not clearly explained. (for example, light object)

Minigame: diagram is good. Content not complete.
where this minigame starts in the game?

End: diagrams would have been better to explain.

Overall,I did not understand the flow of your game.
Scenarios are vague and flow is random throutout the game.
What all levels this game contains?
