<h2>Game Dev's View</h2>

  A method to display the end screen will be called when the player's
  health drops to 0 or when the player reaches the goal. When the 
  end screen is constructed it will take the player's score and the
  time it took them and display them on the screen. There will be 2 
  pressable buttons, the 'Exit' button and the 'Play Again' button.
  Pressing the Exit button will call the System to End the program
  and the Play Again button will create a new instance of the scene
