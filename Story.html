<hr><i>The story of the game (overall narrative)</i><hr>

<p>
The goal is to move to the end of the level so 
the player can steal the lepricaun's gold.
</p>
<p>
The game is going to be split up into 4 main levels,
each will be played in a separate direction (up, down, left, right).
We will have various "powerups" to assist the player on the way to the 
finish of the level.
